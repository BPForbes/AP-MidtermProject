## Preliminaries: Definitions  

### Big-Oh (O)  
A function \( f(n) \) is said to be in \( O(g(n)) \) if there exist constants \( C > 0 \) and \( \delta > 0 \) such that  

\[
\forall n > \delta, \quad f(n) \leq C \cdot g(n).
\]

### Big-Omega (Ω)  
A function \( f(n) \) is said to be in \( \Omega(g(n)) \) if there exist constants \( c > 0 \) and \( \delta > 0 \) such that  

\[
\forall n > \delta, \quad f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n).
\]

### Big-Theta (Θ)  
A function \( f(n) \) is said to be in \( \Theta(g(n)) \) if \( f(n) \) is both in \( O(g(n)) \) and \( \Omega(g(n)) \).

## Problem 3.2.28(a): \( 2^{n+1} = O(2^n) \)  

### **Claim 1**: \( 2^{n+1} = O(2^n) \).  

### **Proof Using the Definition**  
To establish that \( 2^{n+1} = O(2^n) \), we must demonstrate that there exist constants \( C > 0 \) and \( \delta > 0 \) such that for all \( n > \delta \),

\[
2^{n+1} \leq C \cdot 2^n.
\]

#### Step 1: Simplify the Expression  
Observe the relationship between \( 2^{n+1} \) and \( 2^n \):

\[
2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n.
\]

#### Step 2: Formulate the Inequality  
Substituting the simplified expression into the inequality:

\[
2 \cdot 2^n \leq C \cdot 2^n.
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( C \)  
Dividing both sides by \( 2^n \):

\[
2 \leq C.
\]

#### Step 4: Choose Appropriate Constants  
Let \( C = 2 \) and \( \delta = 1 \). Thus, for all \( n > 1 \),

\[
2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n \leq 2 \cdot 2^n.
\]

### **Conclusion**  
With \( C = 2 \) and \( \delta = 1 \), the inequality holds. Thus, by definition, \( 2^{n+1} = O(2^n) \).

### **Proof Using the Ratio Test**  

#### Step 1: Define the Functions  
Let \( f(n) = 2^{n+1} \) and \( g(n) = 2^n \).

#### Step 2: Define the Sequence  

\[
a_n = \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \frac{2^{n+1}}{2^n} = 2.
\]

#### Step 3: Compute the Ratio  

\[
\left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = \left| \frac{2^{(n+1)+1}/2^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}/2^n} \right| = \left| \frac{2^{n+2}/2^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}/2^n} \right| = 1.
\]

#### Step 4: Evaluate the Limit  

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = 1.
\]

#### Step 5: Interpret the Result  
Since the limit is a finite constant (\( 1 \leq C \)), we can choose \( C = 2 \). Thus, the ratio test confirms that:

\[
f(n) \leq C \cdot g(n) \text{ for sufficiently large } n.
\]

**Conclusion:** \( 2^{n+1} = O(2^n) \).

## Problem 3.2.33(a): \( 2^{n+1} = \Omega(2^n) \)  

### **Claim 2**: \( 2^{n+1} = \Omega(2^n) \).

### **Proof Using the Definition**  
To establish that \( 2^{n+1} = \Omega(2^n) \), we must demonstrate that there exist constants \( c > 0 \) and \( \delta > 0 \) such that for all \( n > \delta \),

\[
2^{n+1} \geq c \cdot 2^n.
\]

#### Step 1: Simplify the Expression  

\[
2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n.
\]

#### Step 2: Formulate the Inequality  

\[
2 \cdot 2^n \geq c \cdot 2^n.
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( c \)  

\[
2 \geq c.
\]

#### Step 4: Choose Appropriate Constants  
Let \( c = 2 \) and \( \delta = 1 \). Thus, for all \( n > 1 \),

\[
2^{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^n \geq 2 \cdot 2^n.
\]

### **Conclusion**  
With \( c = 2 \) and \( \delta = 1 \), the inequality holds. Thus, by definition, \( 2^{n+1} = \Omega(2^n) \).
